# js-emblems

![Header](/assets/images/intro.png)

This is a nifty thing that generates a 16x16 grid of DIVs with color-codes based on an input string provided by the user. Converting each provided character into its unique character-code, then applying them procedurely as each of the 64 unique DIVs are produced, what you get is a random-seeming, "emblem". The same string always provides the same emblem, though it's hard to predict inuitiviely what will be generated.

## 3rd Party Tools

### Bootstrap CDN
For the gridding/formatting

### fonts.googleapis
For the fun font

### hipsum.co
This API provides some random text strings.

## To-Do List

1. Emblems rendered as images instead of DIVs
2. Optional Transparent
3. API??? That'd be cool.
